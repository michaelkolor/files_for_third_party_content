**THIS IS A README.DOC FOR THE FILES RELATED TO THE THIRD PARTY CONTENT USER STUDY, BROKEN UP BY SEPARATE FOLDER***
“Bad Website” Folder:
	To mimic the look of the unsafe FreeComputerBooks website while ensuring safety for user, the default href for the links on the page is the homepage (indexNew.html). There are no live advertisements on the page, but they are mimicked using images whose css styles are altered on hover in highlighting_pathways.css. Links to other pages of the website are also mimicked in a similar fashion.  The links are also highlighted to help point out which links are mimicked on the page.  The mimicked images and links redirect to pages that look identical to what would pop up in real life, but any clicks automatically redirect back to the homepage.   The sheets and scripts are injected into indexNew.html right below the head (NOTE: The content_script,js not functional).
“CNN-11-10-2” Folder:
	Scripts and Stylesheets are injected at the top of “CNN - Breaking News, Latest News and Videos.html”. Due to a lack of back-end control on the CNN page, issues with formatting resulted in the survey being posted on the top of the CNN page instead of interspersed throughout.  This survey is injected through cnn_for_third_party_test_labels.js. The labels to the divs selected for the survey are also prepended in this js file, as well as a hover alert for when the user scrolls over a div they need to answer questions about in the survey.  The css stylings for highlighting the featured divs in the survey (and their css selectors) can be found in the cnn_test_for_third_party.css file.  The survey is connected to a SQL database through the files connection.php, index.php, and thankyou.php.  thankyou.php is called as the form action in the code injection in cnn_test_for_third_party.js file (line 7), which links the user submission to the sql database. The first submission of a user is the only one recorded through storing the user’s session id and utilizing the INSERT IGNORE function in thankyou.php. An acknowledgement to the user of a recorded response is also injected through thankyou.php.
“facebook-12-10” Folder:
 This utilizes the same structure for storing the survey results in a sql database as in “CNN-11-10-2”, albeit with different css selectors for the selected divs and a different table name to store the results. The sheets and scripts are also injected right below the head of Facebook.html.
“extension_for_highlighting_third_party_content” Folder:
This chrome extension highlights the third party-content on CNN and Facebook after clicking on a page action icon.  The highlighting is done through an injected css stylesheet that stores selectors for the third party divs on each page.  There is one glitch to the CNN injection in that not all of the paid partner content may be highlighted on the first injection of the stylesheet, however upon refreshing the cnn page the injection seems to be functional.  On the Facebook page, certain third-party video content is not caught by this extension since the video content is uploaded to Facebook manually by the third parties, making the video sources indistinguishable from homemade videos uploaded by Facebook users.
